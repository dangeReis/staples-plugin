# Task 035-038: Unit Tests for Modules

**Branch**: 002-black-box-architecture-tasks/task-035-038-unit-tests-dispatch
**Base Branch**: 002-black-box-architecture
**Tasks**: T035-T038 from ../tasks.md

## Tasks to Implement

### Phase 5: US3 - Independent Testing (T035-T038)
**Unit Tests:**
- [ ] T035 [P] [US3] Unit test for OrderDiscovery with mock DOM in tests/unit/modules/orderDiscovery.test.js
- [ ] T036 [P] [US3] Unit test for ReceiptGenerator with mock Chrome APIs in tests/unit/modules/receiptGenerator.test.js
- [ ] T037 [P] [US3] Unit test for StatusTracker with mock storage in tests/unit/modules/statusTracker.test.js
- [ ] T038 [P] [US3] Unit test for DownloadScheduler with mocks in tests/unit/modules/scheduler.test.js

## Requirements

1. TDD throughout (tests before implementation)
2. Use mock adapters for dependencies.
3. Ensure tests run without a real Chrome runtime.
4. Update ../tasks.md to mark T035-T038 as [X] when complete.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All unit tests for T035-T038 pass.
- ✅ Tests are isolated and use mocks effectively.
- ✅ Tasks T035-T038 marked [X] in ../tasks.md
