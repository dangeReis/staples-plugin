# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Black Box Modularity (Principle I)
- [ ] Primitives identified (Order, Receipt, Status, etc.)
- [ ] Module boundaries defined with clear interfaces
- [ ] Each module has single responsibility
- [ ] Implementation details hidden from interfaces
- [ ] Modules are independently replaceable

### TDD (Principle II - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [ ] Interface tests written BEFORE implementation
- [ ] Contract tests defined for module interactions
- [ ] Tests approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor cycle planned

### KISS (Principle III)
- [ ] Complexity justified (see Complexity Tracking section)
- [ ] No premature abstractions
- [ ] Simplest solution chosen
- [ ] YAGNI principle applied

### Interface-First Design (Principle IV)
- [ ] Interfaces designed before code
- [ ] APIs are simple and semantic
- [ ] Interfaces implementable without knowing internals
- [ ] "What" exposed, "how" hidden

### Primitive-First Architecture (Principle V)
- [ ] Core data types identified
- [ ] Primitives are simple and immutable
- [ ] Consistent primitives used throughout
- [ ] Complex behavior built through composition

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
